<!-- Post goes right in here -->
<p> 
    Welcome back to blogging with Summer! I was thinking about how I could write this post while still bringing a bit of hope to our community and I knew that 
    I just had to show off our new website's layout. I am going to make this very clear that this isn't the exact copy of what you would see on the website 
    besides the layout itself. Lets jump right into some examples! 

    <br/>
<br/>

    So, while you are able to see the new layout you will not be able to see any of the new pages just yet! This is just a teaser of what the new posts are going to 
    look like. You can also check out the nav-bar and see for yourself what that will look like. I will tell you that all the pages that are currently link to that 
    are old pages from our existing website so don't base the other page layouts off of that. I did add a tad functionality since it will be a bit more time unitl 
    the website will be released. So, please go around and look and enjoy! 

    <br/>

<b>"Okay, but Summer, what is the title of the post all about?? </b>
<br/>
<br/> 
    
    Great Question! So, we have been talking back and forth with a bunch of players from 2009scape and we have made a decision based off of this. For awhile now 
    plenty of people have been concerned about their items being wiped so mass sales have been going on with a few people leaving. Which is no biggie, I mean we will miss
    them but it is impossible to please everyone. 

    <br/>
<br/>
<b> World 1 players </b>
<br/>
<br/>
    
    Hi friends! I am one of you! I am crazy enough to play the game as it was with out the need for any QoL that the other world brings. The legacy core had a melee 
    system that was so garbage that you technically weren't even playing x1?? I mean you may scream at me asking what the hell am I talking about. Let me explain. 
    Apparently, with the old combat system you were able to land a hit <b>3x</b> the amount you should have been able to. So training combat was almost as if you were
    x3. Another set back was the whole clean economy. With our Collision of the Worlds update we gave players a chance to leave 
    items with world 1 characters to make it what we deemed fair back then but detrimental to our economy. So a clean wipe is what we had decided was best for the 
    pure world. 

    <br/>
<br/>
<b> World 2 players </b>
<br/>
<br/>

    Hi friends! I am not one of you but that is okay. I still, however, am a member of the staff that does still care about all our players. There has been some concern
    rising about losing the items that had <b>worked</b> for and while I do understand I can not say we are on the same page and this is why I am a world 1 player. So, 
    the idea was to remove all member items since when 2.009 was released all content will first be f2p and then member content will come in a chronological order. The amount 
    of slayer items and just quest locked items like dragon scimitar would have made it a tad unfair to newer players. After all the complaints of the wipe we had decided 
    to allow world 2 players to keep all of their items and let you deal with the economy created from exploits. Quest data will still be deleted but you will keep both 
    your stats and your items on world 2.
    <br/>
<br/>
<b> Update on 2.009 </b>
<br/>
<br/>

    We are currently on v0.9 of the Alpha testing, which means we are getting closer and closer to getting to where we need to be to make a release. We do have some 
    exciting news that I will not be sharing at this time but it will for sure make the wait a lot more worth it when it is finally here. I am super happy that the 
    majority of you have decided to stay even if that means waiting things out. Until next time we will discuss the beta!
