                                                           these opinions he cares deeply for this project and so much so that he spent 10 hour days for majority of days in 2020. He has made the 

                                                           most contributions out of everyone on the server so make sure you tell him how much you appreciate his work!

                                                            Keep in mind that our staff team are all volunteer and are not paid for their customer service. 

                                                            Rule #2 of our server is to not disrespect any staff member. While it's not severe for instant ban it is bannable if continued over and over.

                                                            We're here to build an amazing server and help anyone with any questions they may have of our server. Do not ping a developer unless you are unable to login
