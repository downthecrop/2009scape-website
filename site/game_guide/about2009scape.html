<!-- Introduction of the about sections -->
<p style="margin-left: 3%;"> Every website should have an about section and while this is pretty straight forward of an idea of what we are about we will go into 
        detail about what are future goals are and our past that got us to this point.

<!-- What is 2009scape? -->
<h3> What is 2009scape?</h3>
<p> 2009scape is an unofficial remake of the 2009 era of RS that is usually forgotten. We are aiming towards a full remake of 100% completion which let people relive 
    the RS2HD days once again. A non profit group that is trying something different in the open source community. In the past we have dealt with people both trying 
    to sell the source or exploit bugs in the code for gains in the game. The last mass ban of these exploiters took over 100 million out of the economy. However, 
    with this happening our core is open source while our content is closed source.

<!-- History of 2009scape -->
<h3> History of 2009scape </h3>
<p> 
The 2009Scape you see today has gone through a magnitude of changes. Originally starting its life as Arios498, this server saw a lot of people playing it daily, 
unfortunately, it was for profit and closed source. It was later upgraded to Arios530, targeting the build 530 of runescape with content in and around 
January 1st, 2009. Development came to a halt when a developer of the closed source project released the source code. The original developers of this server went 
on to create Kratos 530 back in 2015.

This project was started out of love for the 530 revision. A small group of developers spent hundreds of hours improving on the existing source that was left to the 
curb. Over the past year, this project has seen many developers coming and going, fixing bugs that they find either through their own server, or bugs that they find 
in the live game that is currently hosted.

<h3> 2009scape as of 2021 </h3>
<p>
As of June 2021, we have decided to split the two games entirely between Legacy and Preservation. Legacy is the base we had started on and was at one point known as 
World 2. The Legacy world 1 was deleted on request of the World 1 players for the making of the Preservation server. The Preservation server was at one point the v2.009 
that was going to replace both worlds but we had decided to keep the legacy code base open source and just make on Preservation world that stayed true to the era of 2009 
no matter how rediculous Jagex's decision were like free trade limits and no wilderness. This is like the name sounds to Preserve the era as a historical server based on the 
578 revision December 22, 2009. Legacy plans on updating from the 530 revision to the 578 revision in the future and with this it brings a whole new map with actual 
2009 updates for our 2009scape server. As of August 2021, Legacy is the only server that is being hosted and is currently being worked on by our developers and contributors 
of the community. Stop by and say hi! and make sure to read our getting started page for Legacy found <a href="how_do_i_get_started0.html">here</a>.
