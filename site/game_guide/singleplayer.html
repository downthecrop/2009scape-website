<b> You should check out the live server before thinking about singleplayer! Always up to date and supported. </b>
<br/>
<br/>
     Why play live instead of Singleplayer? I completely understand being concerned about your player save incase the worse happened where we went down. 
     However, it has been state a multitude of times in the Discord that the player saves belong to the player and if <b><i> God Forbid </i></b> the server 
     went down you would receive a copy of your player save with the updated copy of singleplayer. You can see more of what information we collect if you're 
     concerned on that end using the <a href="../privacy/privacy.html">link</a>
<br/>
<br/>
    Single player is the game mode that makes us super unique and we do take pride in it. The server started to focus mainly on the live server after 
    progress slowed down completely to focus on both the singleplayer copies and the personal servers. At this point we had stopped the support for both 
    singleplayer and personal servers. 

    <br/>
<br/>

    The future is looking bright for singleplayer with the new copies coming out of the new 2.009 core for both Linux and Windows. The official support will begin
    again once those copies are added to the game.

    <br/>
<br/>

    The unsupported official copies of single player are still usuable but super out of date compared to 2009scape Legacy github source code.

<h3 style="color:#675F39; font-size: 12px;"> Is there a point of the GE? </h3>
<p> Yes, server sided bots such a adventure bots still collect resources and sell to your ge. There is a possible way of playing the 
        server offline while still being able to buy things. You can also sell lobster, swordfish, or shark for green dragon killing bots to
        buy.

<h3 style="color:#675F39; font-size: 12px;"> Can I still play minigames? </h3>
<p> Of Course, majority of the minigames do not require other players to play in the first place. But we have special pest control bots 
        that will play pest control with you on the easy and intermediate boats so you can get your very own set of void armour!

<h3 style="color:#675F39; font-size: 12px;"> How do I get the PvP and wilderness bots in Server/plugin/ai to work? </h3>
<p> They never have worked since Arios did not program them right. Another reason we are leaving their core behind us and using our
        own.

<h3 style="color:#675F39; font-size: 12px;"> Is Singleplayer actually Singleplayer or is a local network version? </h3>
<p> It is solely singleplayer like stated earlier there are ways to open your ports up but at that point you should just fork your 
        own personal server.
